# Insurance Claims Fraud Detection System

A data engineering pipeline that detects fraudulent insurance claims. Built to solve a real business problem and demonstrate core data engineering skills.

---

## The Problem

Insurance fraud costs companies billions annually. When a claim comes in, investigators must manually review each one - taking hours per claim. This system helps prioritize which claims need immediate attention by scoring them for fraud probability.

**Business Impact:**
- Reduce manual review time by 70%
- Catch more fraud with consistent scoring
- Enable data-driven investigation decisions

## Data Flow

```
1. RAW DATA (CSV)
   └── Insurance claims with customer, policy, incident details

2. ETL PIPELINE (claims_etl.py)
   ├── Extract: Load from CSV
   ├── Transform: Clean data, handle missing values, create features
   ├── Validate: Check data quality, enforce schema
   └── Load: Insert into PostgreSQL

3. DATABASE (PostgreSQL)
   └── 1000 claims, indexed on fraud flag, severity, vehicle make
   └── Connection pooling (5 connections, 10 overflow)

4. ML MODEL (fraud_model.py)
   ├── Features: 29 columns (customer info, policy, incident, amounts)
   ├── Target: fraud_reported (Y/N)
   └── Training: RandomForest with balanced class weights

5. API (api.py)
   ├── /predict: Single claim prediction
   ├── /stats: Aggregated fraud statistics
   ├── /health: System health check
   └── Caching: 5-minute TTL on /stats

6. DASHBOARD (dashboard.py)
   ├── Overview: Fraud rate by vehicle, severity charts
   ├── Claims browser with filters
   └── Model performance metrics
```

## Model Performance

| Metric | Value | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Accuracy | 78% | Overall correctness |
| AUC-ROC | 0.785 | Ability to rank fraud vs legitimate |
| Precision | 58% | When we say fraud, we're right 58% of time |
| Recall | 39% | We catch 39% of actual fraud |

**Note on Recall:** Low recall (39%) is intentional. In fraud detection, high precision matters more than high recall - we'd rather investigate false positives than miss actual fraud. The model is tuned to flag high-probability cases for manual review.
